The launch of Protocol 21 enables native support of secp256r1 verification in Stellar smart contracts on Mainnet as part of [CAP-0051](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0051.md). And this, in turn, further enables something extremely exciting: passkeys! The ability to sign transactions and access accounts with a passkey rather than using secret keys or seed phrases is a **huge** step forward in easing usability in blockchain without sacrificing security.

This page is meant to: 1. showcase all the work being done on Stellar with passkeys, and 2. give you a basic understanding of secp256r1, WebAuthn, and passkeys.

:::note

This passkey page is meant to keep users up-to-date on the work being done with passkeys by SDF and the Stellar ecosystem. The official documentation for passkeys is a work in progress as we collaborate to create a fully audited passkey contract for use.

## What does it all mean?

### Secp256r1

The [secp256r1 signature scheme](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/SECP256R1+Support) is an elliptic curve that is often used with the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), which is a widely used public key signature scheme.

Secp256r1 is a common signature algorithm used in WebAuthn, which is the standard behind passkeys available on browsers, computers, and phones. Enabling secp256r1 verification allows developers to design contracts that incorporate passkeys to sign smart contract transactions and access accounts instead of using seed phrases or signing keys.

The Stellar blockchain natively uses the Ed25519 elliptic curve, which is extremely fast and secure but is not compatible with WebAuthn.

### WebAuthn

[WebAuthn (web authentication)](https://www.okta.com/blog/2019/03/what-is-webauthn/) is a web standard for secure, passwordless authentication. It uses public-key cryptography to eliminate the reliance on secret keys and enhances security and usability for dapps.

WebAuthn provides decentralized authentication (no central authority manages passwords), enhanced security (secret keys remain on the user‚Äôs device), improved user experience (users don‚Äôt have to worry about remembering their secret keys), and broader interoperability (WebAuthn is already supported by major browsers and platforms).

### Passkeys

Passkeys are an implementation of the WebAuthn standard. The ability to use passkeys to sign transactions and access accounts removes the need for users to remember their secret keys or 12- to 24-word seed phrases, something that has been a massive barrier to entry for end-users entering the blockchain space. Secret keys and seed phrases can be overwhelming, hard to remember, entered incorrectly, and prone to security breaches.

Passkeys offer a faster, more secure method of identity authentication by using encrypted data stored on a device and performing user verification with hardware tokens (like YubiKeys), biometric data (like fingerprints or facial recognition), or other cryptographic methods.

### How they work together

Secp256r1 provides the cryptographic foundation for key generation and digital signatures, WebAuthn offers a standardized framework for passwordless authentication using public-key cryptography, and passkeys implement these technologies to provide a seamless and secure user experience.

**Key generation and storage:**

- When a user sets up a passkey or registers with a WebAuthn service, a key pair is generated using a supported elliptic curve like secp256r1.
- The secret key is stored securely on the user‚Äôs device, while the public key is sent to the service provider.

**Authentication:**

- For authentication, the service provider sends a challenge to the user‚Äôs device.
- The device signs the challenge with the secret key.
- The service provider verifies the signature using the public key.

**User experience:**

- Passkeys simplify this process for users, allowing them to authenticate using biometric data instead of remembering their secret key.
- WebAuthn provides the standard framework for these interactions, ensuring security and interoperability across platforms and devices.
