## Architecture Overview

In general stellar-etl runs by:

* Accepting an export command to export data between a start and end ledger
* Reads the LedgerCloseMeta files from the data lake created from Leger Exporter
* Tranforms the LedgerCloseMeta XDR into an easy to parse JSON format
* Optionally uploads the JSON files to GCS or any other cloud storage service

More detailed information about stellar-etl and examples can be found in the [stellar-etl](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-etl/tree/master) repo.
