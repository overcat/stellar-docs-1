[stellar/stellar-dbt-public docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/stellar/stellar-dbt-public)

## Recommended Usage

Generally if you do not need to modify any of the stellar-dbt-public code, it is recommended that you use the [stellar/stellar-dbt-public docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/stellar/stellar-dbt-public) TODO: This image doesn't exist yet.

Example to run locally with docker:

```
docker run --platform linux/amd64 -ti stellar/stellar-dbt-public:latest <parameters>
```

## Building and Running Locally

### Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/stellar/stellar-dbt-public
```

### Install required python packages

```
pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### Install required dbt packages

```
dbt deps
```

### Running dbt

* There are many useful commands that come with dbt which can be found in the [dbt documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-commands#available-commands)
* Most of stellar-dbt-public will want to use the `dbt build` command which will `run` the model and `test` the model table output
* The first time running stellar-dbt-public you will want to run the following to create the tables

```
dbt build --full-refresh
```

* Subsequent runs can be run with incremental mode (only inserts the newest of data instead of rebuilding all of history every time)

```
dbt build
```

* You can also specify just a single model if you don't want to run all stellar-dbt-public models

```
dbt build --select <model name or tag>
```
