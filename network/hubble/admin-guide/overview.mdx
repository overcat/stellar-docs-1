Hubble is the OLAP database for Stellar network data. It ingests and re-serves the data produced by the Stellar network for historical and analytical purposes.

This guide describes how to administer a production Hubble database in BigQuery using GCP services. For information about developing on the Hubble codebase, check out the [Development Guide] and the links to the relevant GitHub repositories.

It is worth noting that most users will not need to standup and run their own Hubble. The Stellar Development Foundation provides public access to the data through the public datasets and tables in GCP BigQuery. Instructions on how to access this data can be found in the [Connecting](https://developers.stellar.org/network/hubble/connecting) section.

## Why Run Hubble?

Running Hubble within your own infrastructure provides a number of benefits. You can:

- Have full operational control without dependency on the Stellar Development Foundation for network data
- Run modified ETL/ELT pipelines that fit your individual business needs
