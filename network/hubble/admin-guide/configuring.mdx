## Prerequisites

You have enabled the components and services for running Hubble in the [Prerequisites](https://developers.stellar.org/network/hubble/admin-guide/prerequisites) section.

## GCP Composer Airflow

There are two things required for the configuration and setup of GCP Composer Airflow:

* Upload DAGs to the Composer Airflow Bucket
* Configure the Airflow variables for your GCP setup

For more detailed instructions please see the [stellar-etl-airflow Installation and Setup](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-etl-airflow?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-and-setup) documentaiton.

### Uploading DAGs

Within the [stellar-etl-airflow](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-etl-airflow) repo there is an [upload_static_to_gcs.sh](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-etl-airflow/blob/master/upload_static_to_gcs.sh) shell script that will upload all the DAGs and schemas into your Composer Airflow bucket.

This can also be done using the [gcloud CLI or console](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/uploading-objects) and manually selecting the dags and schemas you wish to upload.

### Configuring Airflow Variables

Please see the [Airflow Variables Explanation](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-etl-airflow?tab=readme-ov-file#airflow-variables-explanation) documentation for more information about what should and needs to be configured.
